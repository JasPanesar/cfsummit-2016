# Super Fast Application Development with Mura CMS
Presentation for Adobe ColdFusion Summit 2016.

## Presentation Slides

* [Abbreviated presentation](https://github.com/stevewithington/cfsummit-2016/super-fast-app-development-with-mura-cms-abbreviated.pdf)
  These are the slides used for the "live" presentation. They're incomplete since I demonstrated using actual code, etc.

* [Complete presentation](https://github.com/stevewithington/cfsummit-2016/super-fast-app-development-with-mura-cms-complete.pdf)
  These slides include much more information and are intended to be much more helpful. They include code samples, and even information on areas I did not have time to cover during the "live" presentation itself.
